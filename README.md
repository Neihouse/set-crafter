# SetCraifter 

## Introduction

SetCrafter AI is a tentative project designed to revolutionize the way DJs organize and curate their music libraries. By employing AI-driven categorization and leveraging Spotify's API, SetCrafter AI aims to automate the sorting of large and unorganized DJ libraries into cohesive sets.

## Features

- **Automated Categorization:** Sorts tracks based on where they fit within an hour-long set using seven different categories with 10-minute increments.
- **AI-Driven Classification:** Utilizes nearest-neighbor classification techniques to sort tracks with reasonable accuracy.
- **Integration with Spotify's API:** Enriches metadata with additional data such as energy, acoustics, and danceability.
- **Set Curation:** If successful, a second AI will be developed to curate sets based on unique time categories, BPM, key, and other factors.
